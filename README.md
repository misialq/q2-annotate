QIIME 2 plugin for functional annotation and taxonomic classification of shotgun metagenomes.

## Taxonomic functional attribution

`estimate-tfa` returns two artifacts:

- `feature_load`: a sparse `FeatureTable[Frequency % Properties("tfa")]` with the original sample
  IDs as columns and one feature per observed taxon/gene pair.
- `gene_taxonomy`: `FeatureData[Taxonomy % Properties("tfa")]`, a standard
  taxonomy TSV with `Feature ID` and `Taxon` followed by `Taxon ID` and `Gene ID`.

Feature IDs concatenate the taxon and gene IDs with `|`, for example
`T1|bla_TEM`. Each component is percent-encoded, so a literal `|` becomes
`%7C`, `%` becomes `%25`, and a space becomes `%20`. This keeps IDs readable
and distinct even when an input ID contains the separator. IDs are stable
across runs and input ordering. The mapping retains the original, unescaped
IDs and taxonomy labels.

The `tfa` property marks the frequency table and its companion taxonomy as
representing taxon/gene pairs. They remain compatible with actions accepting
ordinary frequency tables and taxonomy artifacts. The taxonomy's semantic
validator requires nonempty IDs and labels and unique taxon/gene pairs.

For taxon *t*, gene *g*, and sample *s*, a load is the sum over contigs assigned
to *t* of contig abundance in *s* multiplied by the contig's count of *g*.
Only pairs with a nonzero load in at least one sample become rows; sample zeros
stay sparse. Estimation reports an error when no pairs remain, because the
standard taxonomy format requires at least one record.
Fractional abundance-weighted values are preserved without rounding,
following the `FeatureTable[Frequency]` convention used by `q2-mag
estimate-abundance` for RPKM/TPM. Both outputs must be retained to interpret
the table's feature IDs.

`explore-tfa` opens an interactive view of a TFA artifact. Pass an optional
`FeatureData[Taxonomy]` artifact to show taxonomy assignments in the taxon
selector and heatmap; taxon IDs are shown where an assignment is missing.
The full lineage appears in the selector and heatmap tooltip, while the
heatmap axis shows the terminal taxon name. Its heatmap ranks
taxon/function links by total load; selecting a link shows its per-sample
loads as a boxplot and a sample bar chart. Select a taxon or function alone
to sum its matching pairs within each sample. Optional sample metadata adds
categorical columns to the grouping control, so the boxplot can compare
sample groups. A group summary chart can show the sum, mean, or median of
per-sample loads in each group. Samples with zero load and samples missing
metadata remain in the comparison. The heatmap displays up to 100 links, and
the bar chart shows the 100 highest-load samples; the boxplot uses all samples.
The Vega plots use
the same CDN scripts as the existing Kraken 2 visualizer, so viewing them
requires an internet connection.

A larger, reproducible synthetic dataset and a runnable command are in
[`examples/tfa_explorer/README.md`](examples/tfa_explorer/README.md).

The sample-resolved output replaces the older `estimate-tfa` layout, which
summed abundances across samples and used functional feature IDs as sample IDs.
Run `estimate-tfa` again from the original inputs to obtain per-sample loads;
the original layout cannot recover them.

## Installation
_q2-annotate_ is available as part of the QIIME 2 moshpit distribution. For installation and usage instructions please consult the official [QIIME 2 documentation](https://docs.qiime2.org).
